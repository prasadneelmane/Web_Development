        (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾeːnd̪rə d̪aːmoːd̪əɾˈd̪aːs ˈmoːd̪iː] (About this sound listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian
        politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
        from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
        is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Born to a Gujarati family
        in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS
        at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school,
        partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi travelled around India for two years, and visited
        a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a
        full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to
        go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy
        until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

        Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following
        the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered
        complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[a] or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, however a Supreme Court-appointed
        Special Investigation Team (SIT) found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings.[b] His policies as chief
        minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[8] His administration has been criticised
        for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.[c]
